This is a week end challenge from Makers Academy. The goal was to re-create the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, and also create a web interface to play the game. A bonus to the game was to make it a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.

These were the requested functionalities:
- the player should be able to enter their name before the game
- the player will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the player can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared
